# Template README for Web Developer take-home

*Fill this template out before submitting your take-home to your recruiting
coordinator.*

## Introduction

*Thank you for giving me the opportunity to learn some new stuff. I'll admit, developing this webpage
without using any frameworks, with pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, was surprisingly time-consuming.
It was definitely a rude awakening, but I had a great time building it.
As for completeness, I would've liked to have spent more time making it more responsive for 
very small screens.*

## Installation

To setup this project and install it's dependencies...easy! Be sure that you have node installed globally and run the
following command:

```
npm i
```

## Running locally

To run this project locally as a static-webpage, also easy! Run the following command:

```
npm start
```

## Future improvements

*We recognize that building a beautiful and convincing website is not a
simple or speedy task, which is why we'd like to see what future
improvements you would suggest to get this project to a 100% production
ready state. No suggestion is a bad one, and we welcome every detail you
provide.*

## Suggestions

*Beautiful design and I definitely learned a lot while developing this clone. The only thing I would've changed
up was the content. Some of the sections were a bit wordy. I did end up adding a little bit of my own content in some
of the sections, as they seemed incomplete, and corrected some spelling here and there. I edited some of the font colors 
to make them a bit more legible. A little more contrast helped without being too harsh on the eyes.*
